*** Problem                            :popular:growing:not_urgent:expensive:
**** Statement
Difficulty in managing emotional eating, often times triggered by
unreasonable parts of our brain. Allow yourself to be semi-coached. 

**** Customer
Who can we help first? Who wants to be coached? 
How will let themselves be coached? 
  - Long todo list and yet, underutilises calendar
    - constantly seeking some productivity hacks and yet, rarely
      sticks by one
  - Will do the work but lacks managerial chops.
  - Has difficulty estimating how long a certain task would take to finish
  - Forgetful on small tasks which come biting you in the ass later
    on? 
  - Have trouble dealing with variable situation? 

Are you overweight? 
  
**** Frequency and Intensity of problem
  - Every day and every hour
  - daily/weekly/monthly 
  - Lack of control 

**** Solvable problem
Is the problem solvable?
Say, what would non-emotional eaters do? 
  - Emotional eaters: Feel -> Act
  - Non-emotional eaters: Act -> Feel 
  
Whenever we can, we rely on the “fast” system. We share this system
with many animals, and that gives us amazing powers like walking
without falling all the time. This “fast” system is good at pattern
matching (necessary for survival!) and “gut reactions”. But it’s not
good at planning.

Uniquely, thanks to the development of frontal lobe, humans also
possess a “slow” thinking system. This “slow” system is responsible
for complex step-by-step reasoning. It lets us plan future events,
engage in arguments, or follow mathematical proofs.

Because using the “slow” system is so mentally draining, we tend to
default to the “fast” one — even when dealing with intellectual tasks
like coding.

The goal is to slow down the "fast" system, emotional aspect of
eating, down to the level of "slow" system. But instead of one having
to detail out and pioneer each of these slow steps, we use
'templates'. 
  
Confidence comes from setting out what to do and doing it. Let's make
them microtasks and make them do it. 

*** Solution
**** Hypothesis
  1. Observation that support system consisting of a
    person of close relationshipa and a social worker works better
  2. What not to do is equally important as what you do do.
    - identify stressors and make them harder to do
    - identify enablers and make them easier to do
  3. Mint focused on making the user do almost no work at all, by
     automatically editing and categorizing their data, reducing the
     number of fields in their signup form, and giving them immediate
     gratification as soon as they possibly could; we completely
     sucked at all of that. 

**** Onboarding
  - ask: have you gained weight since marriage/birth of first child?
  - ask: Would you like to be better conditioned?
  - ask: have you previously tried to be in a better shape and yet,
    failed? If so, why? 
    - ask: do you feel someone you know/don't know supporting your
      weight-loss endeavor will make things easier? or doesn't make
      any difference at all?
  - ask: can you have 45 minutes uninterrupted  or do you need to
    'coordinate' this well in advance with your partner/family or
    is it sipmly unattainable? 
    - does getting interrupted deter your pursuit? or are you
      unaffected by it? [0-5]
  - ask: do you feel you have eating habits deterimental to your
    health such as emotional eating?
    - select as many as you can

**** Insert events to your calendar
These events should be intervals of 6 minutes or less, given that
I have very little chance of concentrating for 40 minutes straight
without getting interrupted lately, especially since I've been working
remotely. That's the reality for me. 

Each suggested event gives a vote of confidence to a profile
  - For each block of time, invite who will be coming in.
    - inviting profile (to a block of time) by setting status
    - each profile has a set of related 
  - This is good for someone
  - This is bad for someone

Does not necessarily have to be a calendar; could be a web app pushing
event push such as [[https://github.com/jazzband/django-push-notifications][django-push-notification]]

As long as she maintains a good workout regiment and focuses on her
posture, and body mechanics during and after the workouts, she will be
just fine. The problems arise when a person stops moving and paying
. 

One thing lacking in this article is a description on how to engage
muscles that control posture while feeling them work. This is a
concept known as proprioception or neuromuscular re-education. This
can be gained by learning where the muscles are located, how to
(isometrically) contract them, and what it feels like when they are
contracted. Then you practice until it's easy to do. This, in
conjunction with everything this author has mentioned, is a good way
to finally gain posture control.

*** Brief Intervention
Child Obesity
  - digital access

There are two types of interventions: long vs. brief intervention.
My understanding is that long term intervention is currently under
revision by Chad and Chuck's intervention models whereas the job
tasked to myself is to come up with brief intervention. 

Brief intervention are used
  - to engage with those who are not yet ready for change. 
  - increase the person's perception of real and potential risks and
    problems associated with current health style.
  - encourage change by helping the person to consider the
    reasons for change and the risks of not changing.

The key is to get the user to step through each phases of problem solving
that we as a data-driven company can see and do but an uninformed
customer cannot do themselves (unless innately intensely curious about
these things).

I imagine these brief interventions to be of jupyter-notebook like
format in which the user will work through blocks of questions and get the output
embedded in the code.

  - [X] Assess your health situation first. 
    - Are you healthy or unhealthy? 
    - Do you see health risk in future?
  - [ ] Assess the young person's level of attention
    - How did you assess your health?
      - Feels
	- great
	- not
      - Age
      - Weight
        - scale
      - Waist
        - clothes don't fit 
	- I know my measurement
      - Hip
	- clothes don't fit
	- I know my measurement
      - Energy level
	- declining athletic performance
      - Genetics (family history)
      - Types of food you eat
      - Mental
      - Habit
	- Drinking
	- Smoking
	- Drugs
	- Other
      - Exercise level
      - Other
  - [ ] Listen to what the person has to say
    - What can you say about your health? 
    - [ ] Notice what they haven't said or what they do not wish to talk about
  - Present to the user 'this is where you are in terms of health'
    - Data visualisation (as motivation)
  - Empathise with them and their situation
    - Having seen your self, how do you feel? Better? Worse? Indifferent?
    - Is there something you would like to do about it? <- problem solving
      - Lose weight
      - Get into better shape
  - Would you like to set a goal? 
    - Stopping/decreasing bad habit
    - Starting/increasing good habit
    - Support
      - Would you like the app to send reminders? 
      - Do you have two or more people around you who would support your goal?

Brief interventions utilise many of the skills already covered in this
amodule such as motivational interviewing, problem solving,
decisional-balancing and goal setting and requires an understanding of
the process of change.

  - Talk in a non-threatening manner
  - Avoid lecturing them
  - Do NOT assume
    - This person ought to make a change
    - This person wants to make a change
    - This person's health is a prime motivating factor for change
    - If the person decides not to change, the intervention has failed
    - People are either motivated to change or not
    - Now is the right time to consider change
    - A tough approach is most effective
    - I'm the expert. He or she must follow my advice.


It is critical that engagement takes place prior to
effectiveness or else, 
To break down engagement further:
  - accessibility: needs to be accessible
  - trust building: display customer's input/data is shared in an
    appropriate manner and that we understand your needs
    - Stopping the blame game
    - Coregulate 
    - Do you want to lose weight?
      - Eat alone
      - Family related obesity
      - Child obesity
      - Do you eat to fuel yourself (independent manner) or to resolve
        an issue (out of hunger, boredom)
    - Food as medicine
      - emotional nurturance
      - 

  - aha moment where customer/client discovers 


Surveys and Insights, as a tandem forms
`intervention`, one leading the other and vice versa. 

As immediate insight, my goal is to put engagement
